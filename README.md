# Sams-3D-Library
A personal website, made using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript and Unity WebGL to showcase custom made 3D models in an interactive way.

## Context
#### Context
This project started in summer 2022 after I had finished two projects for university pertaining to 3D modeling with Blender. I wanted to have my own little place on the web where I could showcase some of the 3D models that I had created for these projects, to ensure that they wouldn't just sit on a hard drive somewhere, never to be seen again. 3D models take a lot of time to make; so in my opinion, they deserve all the attention they can get. 
<br>
<br>
#### Why HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Initially, I began with just a regular 2D website, which started out as part of some coursework on HTML and CSS. I thought about reworking the website, making heavier use of frameworks such as Bootstrap or others, but deliberately opted not to, in order to get a clearer grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe it is important to get hands-on experience with any new language first, before efficient use of the frameworks and technologies that build on them can be made. 
<br>
<br>
#### Unity WebGL Version
During the making of the 2D website, the idea of also creating an interactive WebGL version of the website in Unity randomly popped into my head. I have always been interested in game development, which is why I picked up 3D modeling in the first place some time ago. I felt like adding a Unity WebGL version of the 3D library was simply the natural next step. 
<br>
<br>
#### Current State
The website currently has 6 models on it, which can all be downloaded/purchased on CGTrader and TurboSquid (or ripped from the files of this repository if you're smart). More 3D models will be uploaded further down the line, some of which can be seen under [Upcoming Models](#Upcoming-Models). I highly appreciate any visits to the [Website](https://sams3dlibrary.com/).
