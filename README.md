## Context
I started this little side project in summer 2022 after having finished two projects for university pertaining to 3D modelling with blender. I wanted to have my own little place on the web where I could showcase some of the 3D models i had made over the course of these projects, so that they wouldn't just sit on a harddrive somewhere, never to be seen again. 3D Models take a lot of time to make, so I think they deserve all the attention they can get. Initially I started out with the regular 2D website, which started out as part of some coursework about learning how to use HTML and CSS. I thougt about reworking the website with heavier uses of frameworks and such but opted not to, in order to get a more firm and clearer grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript myself. I believe it is important to get hands on and "dirty" with any new language you learn, before you can make efficient use of the frameworks and technologies that build on them. During the course of making the 2D website, I got the idea to also make an interactive WebGL version of the website in Unity. I have always been interested in game development, which is why i picked up 3D modelling some time ago in the first place. I felt like also making an interactive version of the website in Unity was simply the natural next best course of action to take. The website currently has 6 models on it, which can all be downloaded/purchased on cgTrader (or ripped from the files of this repository if you're smart). I will be uploading some of my other 3D models further down the line, some of which can be seen under [Upcoming Models](#Upcoming-Models). I highly appreciate and visits to the [Website](https://sams3dlibrary.com/).
